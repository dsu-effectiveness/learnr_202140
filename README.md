The DSU R colloquium for the fall of 2021 was attended mainly by the Office of Institutional Effectiveness. A big thank you to <a href="https://github.com/allisonhorst">Allison Horst</a> for her R related artwork. Her images make learning R so much more fun.

<h4>Once you have cloned the Repo</h4>

Once you have cloned the repo, you should look through the files using RStudio. The first files we will work with are in the folder 01_getting_started. The materials in the getting started folder will be covered in our meetings from July 29 to August 12. The topics we will cover are

- Intro to RMarkdown
- Intro to ggplot2
- Intro to dplyr

The first file you should open is the file 00_intro_to_markdown.Rmd. If you can open that file and "knit" it, you are ready to roll!
